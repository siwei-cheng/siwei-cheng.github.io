<h2 id="the-mapjob-project">The MapJob Project</h2>
<p>The <em>Mapping Job Structure (MapJob) Project</em> develops a relational framework to study the structure and evoluation of jobs. This framework highlights the inter-connectedness between jobs, workers and their associated attributes (e.g. skills, location). This project combines various sources of data from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, ONET, as well as data gathered from online job postings and resumes. This project received support from the Russell Sage Foundation and the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.</p>
<h2 id="the-cc-project">The C&amp;C Project</h2>
<p>The <em>Communities and Connections (C&amp;C) Project</em> examines inequality in individuals&rsquo; and communities&rsquo; connectedness to resources and opportunities. It also explores how community-level interventions may help reduce this inequality. Connectedness to a network of places, facilities, social circles, local institutions, and job opportunities (or lack thereof) shape many aspects of youthâ€™s life chances including educational attainment, upward social mobility, economic opportunities, physical and mental health, and political participation. While my prior research has mostly considered individuals and communities as independent units of analysis, this project will look into the complex network of connections between them.</p>
<h2 id="the-inter-intra-project">The Inter-Intra Project</h2>
<p>The <em>Inter- and intra-generational (Inter-intra) Mobility Project</em> builds on recent developments in machine learning and causal inference to understand how inequality unfolds over the life course and across generations.</p>
