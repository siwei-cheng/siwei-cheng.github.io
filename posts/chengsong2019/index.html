<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Most intergenerational mobility studies rely on either snapshot or time-averaged measures of
earnings, but have yet to examine resemblance of earnings trajectories over the life course of
successive generations. We propose a linked trajectory mobility approach that decomposes
the progression of economic status over two generations into associations in four life-cycle
dimensions: initial position, growth rate, growth deceleration, and volatility. Using fatherson dyad data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we show that men resemble their
fathers not only in the overall level of earnings but also in the pattern by which their earnings
develop over time. The intergenerational persistence of earnings varies substantially across
life stages of both generations; it is strongest for fathers’ early-career and sons’ mid-career,
with an intergenerational elasticity (IGE) as high as .6. This result can be explained by the
concurrence of the parent’s early career and the offspring’s early childhood. Our findings
suggest the intergenerational economic association between parents and offspring is not
age-constant but is contingent on the respective life stages of both generations and, most
importantly, the period during which they overlap.</p>
